# simple_UA_validation_app
:dart: The goal of this project is to train different techniques while creating a very simple functional app!

:sparkles: Bellow is a short list of the features of this app:

  - Input for Username.
  - Input for age (number in years).
  - List of displaying the above.

:art: For the visual styling i have used:

  - Html/Css,
  - Css modules.

:card_index_dividers: Bellow is a list of the different techniques i practised:

  - Splitting the app in normal amount of reusable components (e.g. custom button).
  - Handling events (such as clicks and submissions).
  - Managing states / using React Hooks.
  - Lifting state up to parrent of various components.
  - Implementing a simple check / validation of the input fields and conditionally outputting results.
  - Showing extra card conditionally to help and hint errors to the user of the app.

:gear: Usefull information about the app:

  - This app was made using VS Code.
  - To get this app up and going you need to run the two following commands seperately: npm install, npm start.

Special thanks to mr Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and his react course!
